\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{What specific activities will you be working on this summer?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s In my research project, I am expected to read scientific literature (papers,
  books ,etc.), record all useful information/analysis on a latex documents such as this, and
 code in python to run experiments on quantum computers on IBM cloud.
\end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{How do your activities support the larger work of
  the research project? If you are not sure, what information do
  you need to answer this question?}
 \begin{itemize}
   \s The overarching goal of my research project is to study how quantum computers
   can help find ground state energies of small molecules within chemical
   accuracy. My work on error mitigation techniques will help improve the accuracy
   of those ground state energy computations, especially on noisy quantum computing
   devices.
 \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{What will define "progress" for the project you are working on?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s Progress will be defined by the accuracy of ground state energies of \(H_2\) and
  \(LiH\) molecules obtained from running experiments on noisy quantum computers. Specifically,
  I have to be able to extract results within chemical accuracy given that
  the quantum computing devices are plagued with noise i.e. imperfections in storing
  information.

  \noindent Such progress will require deep understanding of some error mitigation
  techniques and running experiments utilizing those techniques on simulators (which
  mimick noisy quantum devices).
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{ Where will you primarily do your work (in a lab, the field, an office)?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s I work at my home office customized with ``Lord of the Rings'' posters
  and stuffed toys! 
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Who do you work with on a day to day basis?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s I am in constant contact with my faculty mentor to discuss
  problematic issues through Zoom, Slack and e-mail. Other than these
  meetings, we also meet Professor Mark Hillery, a friend of my faculty mentor
  with expertise in this subject, once a week.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Who will be your primary resource when you have questions?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s My primary source will be my faculty mentor for questions. If my faculty
  mentor is unable to help me, I can contact Professor Mark Hillery at City
  University of New York for queries by e-mail.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{How often do you meet to discuss your work with your faculty mentor? If you are working primarily with another member of the research team, how often do you discuss the work with that person?}
\begin{itemize}
  \s I meet with my faculty mentor every other day if not every day. These
  meetings usually last from 30 mintues to 1 hour.
\end{itemize}
