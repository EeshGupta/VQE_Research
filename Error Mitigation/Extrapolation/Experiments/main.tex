\title{Extrapolation Experiments}
\author{Eesh Gupta}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
In this document, we will aim to perform VQE experiments on
Hydrogen molecule \(H_2\) and Lithium Hydride \(LiH\) using extrapolation.
Extrapolation is an error mitigation strategy that aims to better the results
by deliberately increasing the noise rate. It has been successfully deployed
on the above mentioned molecules. Our aim here is to reproduce those
experiments on simulators if not real quantum devices.

To get there, we will perform simpler experiments first, each of which give us
a particular insight/tool to solve the larger problem.

\section{Preliminary experiments}
\textit{Questions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How do we ``rescale'' noise in a quantum circuit with only 1 qubit and 1 gate?
  \item Can  we extrapolate up to 2 order of magnitude and get better results?
\end{itemize}
}
\section{Single Qubit Clifford Gates}
\textit{Questions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How do we ``rescale'' noise given that our 1 qubit circuit contains multiple single qubit gates?
  \item Can we extrapolate it to at least 2 orders of magnitude and get better
  results?
\end{itemize}
}
\section{Multi Qubit Clifford Gates}
\textit{Questions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How do we ``rescale'' with both single and multi qubit gates?
  \item Can we extrapolate it to at least 2 orders of magnitude and get better
  results?
\end{itemize}
}
