AI

I love computer science. From formal language automatons to greedy algorithms,
I am simply fascinated by the reaches of technology to solve daily problems.
It is the reason why I worked on research project with UNL on creating games
for AGPOCALYPSE project. It is also the reason why I created my own quantum
simulation project in which I designed a quantum computing simulator in Python
which you can use to run elementary quantum programs and even run grovers
search algorithm. wIth the help of Professor Schnetzer from the physics
department, I am currently working on simulating ground state energies
of particles using NISQ devices.
You see, I wanna drive innovation. I wanna create and be so good that people
just can't ignore me annd thats what I wanna do for you as well. I want to
study Artificial intelligence, a tool that is automating so many important
functions. I wanna be part of this movement.
Please take me in PLEAAAASE.
