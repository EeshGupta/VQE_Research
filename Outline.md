# Error Mitigation using Neural Networks

## Introduction 

### Why did I do this work? 
- Recently, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm – Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) – has been devised which optimizes electrons in molecular
orbitals to minimize the energy of molecular systems.

- However quantum computers are highly susceptible to errors due to imperfect qubits and gates.

- Errors also stem from decomposing the Hamiltonian into pauli terms in VQE 

- If there was a way to directly measure the Hamiltonian without Pauli decomposition, then variance in results might be 
reduced.


### What is my hypothesis?

Using a neural network  as opposed to Hamiltonian Averaging on optimized circuit in VQE will improve precision and accuracy of energy estimates

## Results

### What was measured? 

### What did I find?

## Conclusion

### Was the hypothesis proved or disproved? 

### Why does it make a difference

### What did I learn?
