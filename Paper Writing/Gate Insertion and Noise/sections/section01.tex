Some of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers lie in solving classically intractable problems in chemistry, leading to potential breakthroughs in disease prevention. However, quantum computers of today are both highly susceptible to errors and limited by the number of qubits to correct them. For the near term, scientists are exploring error mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of quantum computational noise. One such popular technique is Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) which approximates the ‘zero error’ solution by deliberately increasing the noise in the device.

In this paper, we focus on studying the noise amplification scheme of identity
insertion under different types of error sources. Identity Insertion for CNOT gate involves adding pairs of CNOT (\(U_c U_c = I\)) to increase the error rate of the original gate.
